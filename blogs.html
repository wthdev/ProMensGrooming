      <h2>How to get Pink lips Naturally for mens with Home Indgrediants</h2>
      <h5>Author: Devashish Chhetri Date: 09-June-2022</h5>
      <p>
        1. Use A Sugar Scrub Scrub the lip skin with a mixture of one teaspoon
        each of almond oil and honey and two teaspoons of sugar. Scrub gently as
        the skin on your lips is quite sensitive. The almond oil and honey will
        give your lips moisture even as the sugar removes the dead skin. Regular
        usage of this scrub can give you pink lips permanently. <br> <br> 2. Use Beetroot
        Grate a small, peeled beetroot and extract its juice. Dab it on your
        lips using your fingertips and leave it on for 15 minutes. Wash it off
        later. You can repeat this twice a week to see quicker results. The
        natural burgundy pigment in beetroot helps in making your lips softer
        and pink. <br> <br> 3. Use Aloe Vera And Honey Take one tablespoon of freshly
        extracted aloe vera gel from a plant and mix it with honey. Apply it on
        your lips. Leave it for 15 minutes and wash it with water to see instant
        results. Both aloe Vera and honey add hydration to your lips, thus
        making it soft and pink. <br> <br> 4. Exfoliate Regularly All you need to do is
        wet a napkin or a toothbrush and gently rub your lips with it in gentle
        movements. This removes dead skin and the dry outer layer of the lips,
        while also improving blood circulation. At night, always apply coconut
        oil or a natural lip balm for soft pink lips. <br> <br> 5. Use Sunscreen A study
        [1] found that 37% of people who use sunscreen the right way also use it
        to protect their lips. Opt for a lip balm that has SPF 15 or more. It
        needs to be applied daily and refreshed frequently. This prevents damage
        from the sun’s rays. <br> <br> 6. Moisturise Regularly Keeping your lips moist at
        all times is a sure shot way to ensure they remain pink. Use aloe vera
        gel directly from the plant or buy a pure bottled version to soothe and
        hydrate dry lips. <br> <br> 7. Hydrate Internally Drinking more water to stay
        hydrated will prevent dry and chapped skin. It will also keep your lips
        looking plump and moist, while also keeping discoloration of lips at
        bay.
